# YOmegle
A tampermonkey userscript used to modify and add more features to omegle. Currently, the script can:

* stop omegle from automatically switching you to normal text mode after failing to find someone who matches your interests.
* show you the identities of strangers on omegle.
* prevent the annoying terms from popping up.
* set alias for strangers, so you can remember who they are.
